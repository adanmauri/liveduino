# Architecture Decision Records

One file per decision: `NNNN-<kebab-slug>.md` whose first line is `# NNNN. <Title>`, numbered
sequentially and never renumbered. A superseded ADR stays in place with its status changed and a
link to its successor. Start from [`template.md`](template.md).

The ADR holds the rationale; the rules in [`.agents/rules/`](../../.agents/rules/) hold the
checklist and cite the ADR instead of repeating it. `make check` fails on a numbering gap, a
heading that disagrees with its file name, an ADR missing from this index, or a broken relative
link anywhere in the docs. A number taken by a branch that has not merged yet goes under
**Reserved** so it is not reported as a gap.
